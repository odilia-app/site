      <description>We know it has been a long time, however we are delighted to inform you that the first Odilia prototype is up on GitHub, with a very early alpha stage build for anyone curious enough to try it out.
If you want to try it out, the link is here:
https://github.com/yggdrasil-sr/yggdrasil-prototype/releases/
the screen reader can&amp;rsquo;t do much at the moment, however this is what it can do so far
  like any normal screen reader, it can read most components exposed by the Linux accessibility interface, such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.</description>
